# Projectm 2

## Intro
In this project, I test the self-constructed image histogram equalization function and build-in function provided by OpenCV (python API)

## How to run the code
> Make sure that opencv and numpy package is installed
```
python main.py
```
There are four outputs. Two is about the spillway, self-contructed histogram equalization and build-in function. The other two is about the hidden horse.

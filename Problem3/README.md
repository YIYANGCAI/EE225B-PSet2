# Project 3

## Intro
This project test the low frequency-pass filter based on gaussian filters.

## How to run the code
> opencv and numpy are pre-required
```
python main.py
```

## Outputs
result_a.jpg is the output of question (a)

result_b_1.jpg and result_b_2.jpg are the outputs of question (b). The former is the filter's processing result of the input's negative pair. The latter is the threshold result, and the top-right square is the only element exists.

For question (c), result_c_shades.jpg is the filter's procossing result and result_c_1.jpg is the final output after the division.
